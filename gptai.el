;; This is intended to allow for development and programming queries into the
;; OpenAI API.  This allows for sending queries straight from Emacs directly into
;; various models of OpenAI's platform.  It is a barebones implementation of a
;;     wrapper around the API focused on achieving extensibility.

;; Configurations that are required are listed as follows:
;;
;; - Define the desired model to use (available models can be found by running
;;   gptai-list-models which will populate the gptai-models variable with the
;;   list of all available models, it will also display this list in the gptai
;;   buffer).
;;
;; - Define your OpenAI API key.
;;
;; - Optionally define keybindings for sending various queries easily.
;;
;; An example of these configurations after installing from MELPA is shown
;; below:
;;
;;   (require 'gptai)
;;   ;; set standard configurations
;;   (setq gptai-model "<MODEL-HERE>")
;;   (setq gptai-username "<USERNAME-HERE>")
;;   (setq gptai-api-key "<API-KEY-HERE>")
;;   ;; set keybindings optionally
;;   (global-set-key (kbd "C-c o") 'gptai-send-query)
